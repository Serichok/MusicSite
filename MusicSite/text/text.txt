Working with Data
·  Connect to an open API (e.g.,
tracks or something you want).
·      
Create
fake data in JSON and display it on the page (e.g. tracks).
1.Add
a search function (e.g., search tracks or song name).
2. Implement
filtering (e.g., show only tracks of a certain category or as you want).
3.Implement
sorting (e.g., sort tracks by alphabate or as you want).
4. Create
a "Load more" button or infinite scroll to display extra data.
5.Add
a favorites system (e.g., mark some items as favorites and show them in a
separate section).
6. Save
user preferences in LocalStorage (e.g., theme, favorite items, form data).
7. Create
simple pagination (e.g., split a large list of data into pages).
